This is a collection of some of the tips and tricks i've picked up from weird corners of the internet.

## Why make this site?
I wanted to push my learning forward in order to improve my skills and my job prospects. I felt like it was a good idea to publish anything interesting i found on here. Plus, it gave me an excuse to brush up on frontend stuff.
I believe that by sharing knowledge, i can help others solve problems even by just a little bit.

This site is hosted on a 1GB Racknerd VPS behind Cloudflare and uses the Jekyll site generator. You can find the source code to this website on [my github](https://github.com/0xlearndev/website).
Interested in learning how to do this yourself? I'll write about how i set this all up. In the meantime, keep an eye out for new posts.

Email me at admin at learndev.me with any feedback or questions :)
